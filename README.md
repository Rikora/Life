# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life (Life), is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway in 1970. The traditional implementation
requires no user input, as the evolution of cells is determined by the applications initial state. Although, in this version, the user is able to interact with the game and its state by left-clicking (cells become alive) and right-clicking (alive cells become dead).
